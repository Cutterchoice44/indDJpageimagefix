    <h1>Privacy Policy for Cutters Choice Radio Alexa Skill</h1>
    <p><em>Last updated: 6 September 2025</em></p>

    <p>
      Cutters Choice Radio (“we”, “us”, “our”) does <strong>not</strong> collect, store, or sell any personal
      information through the Cutters Choice Radio Alexa Skill. We do not run user accounts in the skill,
      and we do not retain any data on our servers from your interactions with the skill.
    </p>

    <h2>How the skill works</h2>
    <p>
      The skill streams audio from our radio provider via a secure Icecast endpoint operated by Radio Cult
      and uses Amazon’s AudioPlayer interface to play the stream on your Alexa-enabled device.
    </p>

    <h2>Information processed by third parties</h2>
    <p>
      Although we don’t collect data via the skill, the following third parties process information needed
      to operate your device and the audio stream:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Amazon (Alexa)</strong> may process voice interactions, device identifiers, and usage
        telemetry under Amazon’s own privacy notices. See the
        <a href="https://www.amazon.com/alexa-privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amazon Alexa Privacy Notice</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Radio Cult (streaming)</strong> operates the Icecast server that delivers the audio stream.
        Their infrastructure may log standard technical data (e.g., IP address, timestamps) for security
        and reliability. We do not receive personally identifying listener analytics from them.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Children’s privacy</h2>
    <p>
      The skill is not directed at children. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.
      If you believe a child has provided personal information via this skill, please contact us and we will
      investigate and take appropriate action.
    </p>

    <h2>Your rights</h2>
    <p>
      As a New Zealand-based service, we aim to align with the <em>Privacy Act 2020 (NZ)</em>. Depending on your
      location, you may have rights to access or request deletion of personal information held by third parties
      (e.g., Amazon). Please consult those providers’ privacy notices for how to exercise your rights with them.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes to this policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this policy from time to time. We will post any changes on this page and update the “Last updated”
      date above. Material changes will be highlighted for clarity.
